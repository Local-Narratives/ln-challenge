                The women of Matholi Village have pioneered a unique initiative
                in sustainable tourism and community development. The entire
                village is managed by local women, offering visitors an
                unparalleled opportunity to experience rural entrepreneurship,
                sustainable tourism, and agro-tourism. These women have
                transformed their traditional roles into a powerful economic and
                social force, creating a model for women-led tourism in the
                Himalayan region. Visitors consistently praise the warmth,
                knowledge, and entrepreneurial spirit of these women, who share
                not just their homes and food, but their wisdom, traditions, and
                vision for a sustainable future.
